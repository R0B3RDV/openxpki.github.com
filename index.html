    based on the x509 cryptography standard.</p>

    <h2>Project Status</h2>
    <p>As of Summer 2015 the core and new webui are quite stable and we are
    doing some final polishing. The plan is to release <tt>one dot zero</tt>
    on the 10th anniversary of the project in October 2015. There are already
