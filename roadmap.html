    <h1>Roadmap / Releases</h1>

    <h2>Release Cycle</h2>
    <p>We do not have an official release cycle but we plan to publish
    new releases whenever we add new functionality or in case we find any
    severe bugs.</p>

    <h2>Versioning</h2>
    <p>We follow the semantic versioning guidlines [[semver.org]], so you
    are able to update within the 1.x branch at any time without touching
    your config.</p>

    <h2>Roadmap / Version 1.x</h2>

    <ul>
    <li>REST API for request/renewal of certificates</li>
    <li>Extend SOAP API for request/renewal of certificates</li>
    <li>Dedicated renewal workflow</li>
    <li>....</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Roadmap / Version 2.x</h2>
    <p>Those features are considered to require some more heavy lifting in 
    the core and might break APIs, so they are scheduled for a 2.x 
    release.</p>
