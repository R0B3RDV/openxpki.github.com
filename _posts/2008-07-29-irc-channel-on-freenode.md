	 IRC channel #openxpki on freenode

	 Hi all,

	 recently, I've created the #openxpki channel on the freenode network
	 (irc.freenode.net). If you'd like to ask or answer questions related
	 to OpenXPKI, I'll be logged in there and am happy to help (even though
	 sometimes I might not be near the keyboard for a while, so post your
	 question and be patient if noone answers immediately) ...

	 See you there?
	 Cheers,
	     Alex
