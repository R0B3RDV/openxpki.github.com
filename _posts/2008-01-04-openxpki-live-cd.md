	New OpenXPKI Live (beta) released

	Hi all,

	I am happy to announce that I've just uploaded the second version of
	our OpenXPKI Live CD. It uses a fresh subversion snapshot, so it
	has more features and a nicer user interface than the last version.
	Plus, I have also implemented the promised feature that allows you
	to carry around your CA on a CD and a USB flash drive.
	The feature also allows for the inclusion of data from the USB drive
	into the CD - you can customize a lot of things with this method.
	The CD also includes clca, a command line CA tool developed by Martin
	Bartosch, which can be used to create a simple root CA (with or
	without nCipher HSM support).

	You can download the ISO image at
	http://osdn.dl.sf.net/sourceforge/openxpki/openxpki_live_beta_20080105.iso
	for now. Once it has been distributed to the mirrors, please use
	http://downloads.sourceforge.net/openxpki/openxpki_live_beta_20080105.iso

	Best regards,
	  Alex
