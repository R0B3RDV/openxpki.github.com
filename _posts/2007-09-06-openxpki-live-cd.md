	 OpenXPKI Live (beta) released

	 Hi all,

	 I proudly present the first (beta) release of OpenXPKI Live, a Morphix-based
	 live CD with a working OpenXPKI deployment. This will enable potential
	 users to quickly try out OpenXPKI to see if it meets their requirements
	 and the developers to reproduce bugs in a controlled environment.
	 In the future, it may also serve (together with a USB storage device,
	 for example) as a standalone, out of the box PKI system.

	 You can download the ISO image at
	 http://osdn.dl.sf.net/sourceforge/openxpki/openxpki_live_beta_20070906.iso
	 for now. Once it has been distributed to the mirrors, please use
	 http://downloads.sourceforge.net/openxpki/openxpki_live_beta_20070906.iso

	 I've also checked in the 'source' from which the CD can be easily
	 generated.

	 Enjoy,
	   Alex
