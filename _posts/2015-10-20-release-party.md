title: "OpenXPKI Release Event + Workshop"
---

The core team decided that the 10th anniversary of the project would be a great opportunity for the offical release of "OpenXPKI 1.0" and we want to invite you to join the *OpenXPKI Release Event on October 20th* in Frankfurt am Main.

We will have a workshop/presentation about the project from 2.00pm to 5.00pm and move to a more casual location afterwards where you can talk to the developers and other users while enjoying a beverage. The workshop will be held in the office of White Rabbit Security GmbH, Moselstrasse 4, 60329 Frankfurt, which is a five minute walk from the main train station. You are invited to join one or both events, but we ask you to send us an email to office@whiterabbitsecurity.com so we can ensure to have enough seats and drinks ready. You will receive the details about the evening event after registration.

We also want to celebrate the recent foundation of White Rabbit Security, which is the new company driven by some of the core developers of OpenXPKI. So there won't be any charges for the workshop and also the beer is on us.

PS: The presentation will be targeted towards developers, admins and managers. Please let us know if there are topics of special interest and we will try to include them.
