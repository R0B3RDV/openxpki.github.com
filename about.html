    <h1>About the Project</h1>

    <h2>Project History</h2>
    <p>The OpenXPKI project started back in 2005 when contributors and users 
    of the OpenCA software came together on a workshop to discuss the future 
    evolution of the project. As the original project looked somewhat dead 
    and copyright and licensing was an issue, the new project was set up and
    started development of a new system based on the results of this workshop.
    
    Backed with some fundings from companies and universities, a first 
    production deploymemt was done by Martin Bartosch on 2007-01-26
    for his customer. As of today, this deployment is still running
    and doing well...</p>
